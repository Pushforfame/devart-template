## Description
I want to collect stories about people as a snapshot of them in time and space. The Push for Fame installation comes with a button and a camera. People take pictures by themselves, capturing and broadcasting their own story at that time and place.

## Video Installation Description ##
Hi, we are Push for Fame - a series of video installations that live on streets of NYC and Shanghai. We care about all human issues including yours.

If you see us on streets, think us as a serendipitous expedition for you to address issues that you care about. With just one push on the display window, we can be friends. 

You can find us at Waverley & Broadway or the Adaptive Design Association in NYC, United States. Also you can reach us at NYU ITP in Shanghai, China. Come visit us, and push the button and show your face!

We want to use installation as next step plan. We use face recognation and time as the element to the algorithm. People come to gallry and press the button. The mechine will print out a match picture.We invite audience as curator to curator this photography show. The exhibition will over time base on audience and time.
