## Description
Hi, we are Push for Fame - a series of video installations that live on streets of NYC and Shanghai. We care about all human issues including yours.

If you see us on streets, think us as a serendipitous expedition for you to address issues that you care about. With just one push on the display window, we can be friends. 

You can find us at Waverley & Broadway or the Adaptive Design Association in NYC, United States. Also you can reach us at NYU ITP in Shanghai, China. Come visit us, and push the button and show your face!
