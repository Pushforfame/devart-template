Project Concept

"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes," said Andy Warhol. Push for fame is an Push for Fame is a collective narrative interactive window display inspired by Warhol's quote. We use two basic elements - a button and a screen - which engaged people to take pictures in this public space.  Push for Fame shows the egalitarian nature of public art and self-portraits in public space.
