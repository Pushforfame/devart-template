#### Project Concept ####

"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes," said Andy Warhol. Push for Fame is a collective narrative interactive window display inspired by Warhol's quote. We use two basic elements - a button and a screen - which engage people to take pictures of their faces in public space. In other words, Push for Fame shows the egalitarian nature of public art and self-portraits in public space.

#### Who is the audience? ####


General public is our main audience. In different locations, we want to organize different themes for push. We also wish to provide different settings to interact with general public. We will keep our combination of button and camera as a main medium to interact with our audience.
