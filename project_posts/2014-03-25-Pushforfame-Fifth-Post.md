We want to use installation as final out put. Here is the scenario.

###Step01.

We plan to set up exactly same installation of Push for Fame in an empty gallery. This installation  will have an additional function to print out pictures.

###Step02. 

General public can come to the gallery and press the button. Located machine will find a matched picture based on face detecting algorithm. The matched picture will be selected by how similar people look like and by the time picture was taken.

###Step03. 

We will give people markers, so that they can name the printed/selected picture or write desctiption.

###Step 04. 

People can curate the gallery by posting them wherever they want.

####This exhibition will always vary based on time and people who come. Our goal is to let the audience be floating curators.
